            This is the <strong>official HQ</strong> of the SickWidIt Fantasy Football League ‚Äî aka the SWI FF Hub.  
            Greetings! This will be the central hub for all things SickWidIt Fantasy Football‚Ä¶ 
            I will be gradually building this site out‚Ä¶ At its core, I want it to be a repository for all information on our league. 
            <br><br>
            I think:
            A) all of the texts have gotten a bit cumbersome for most of us, and 
            B) it‚Äôs very difficult to find key bits of information when you have to sift through text after text, after meme, after GIF, etc‚Ä¶ 
            So, with this site, I will organize the information, provide an FAQ, provide a search function, provide a platform to ask questions, provide a platform to talk about whatever and anything else‚Ä¶ 
            <br><br>
            If you‚Äôd like to see any other features/functionality introduced to the website, send me a text üôÇ !

                <h3>Trophy</h3>
                <p>
                  ~$15 of your buy-in will go toward the trophy this year. I‚Äôll probably get something like a perpetual trophy (one with mini-plaques we can engrave each year). Input is welcome, but I‚Äôm not picky ‚Äî just want it to be passable and engravable.

                <h3>Keeper-Draft Specifics</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Each manager gets up to <strong>three keepers</strong>.</li>
                  <li>You can own a player for up to 3 years (meaning you can keep him twice).</li>
                  <li>Keepers must be taken in the round they were drafted.</li>
                  <li>If taken from the waiver wire, the player is a <strong>last round</strong> keeper.</li>
                  <li>If all 3 keepers were waiver pickups, they can be your 14th, 15th, and 16th picks.</li>
                  <li>If you drop and reacquire a player in the same season, you must take him at his original draft round.</li>
                  <li>If two keepers fall in the same round, one will go in the next round.</li>
                </ul>
          
                <h4>Examples:</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>If you have two 5th-rounders and one 7th-rounder, you keep them in rounds 5, 6, and 7.</li>
                  <li>If you have one 15th and two 16th-rounders, they become your 14th, 15th, and 16th picks.</li>
                </ul>
          
                <p>
                  <strong>Deadline to lock picks:</strong> August 24, 2025 @ 6:00 PM
                </p>
          
                <h4>How to Lock Your Keepers:</h4>
                <ol>
                  <li>Go to the ESPN app/site and log in.</li>
                  <li>Navigate to your fantasy team.</li>
                  <li>Select the <strong>‚ÄúLeague‚Äù</strong> tab.</li>
                  <li>Click <strong>‚ÄúKeepers‚Äù</strong>.</li>
                  <li>Enter up to 3 keepers. You can edit your picks until the deadline.</li>
                </ol>
          
                <p><em>Miss the deadline? Sucks to suck‚Ä¶ no keepers for you.</em></p>
          
                <p>
                  Once the lock is in, I‚Äôll place your keepers in the proper rounds.
                  You can check draft history by going to your team‚Äôs home > ‚ÄúLeague‚Äù tab > ‚ÄúDraft Recap‚Äù. Use the dropdown in the top right to see previous years.

                <h3>Bets and Fees</h3>
                <p><strong>Entry Fee:</strong> $50</p><br>
                <p>
                  If you need to pay later, just pay when you can. I only need it in time to pay the winners.
                </p>
                <p>
                  $50 will be the ongoing fee for now. If you‚Äôre worried about continuing in the league due to cost, please contact me. We don‚Äôt want anyone to leave ‚Äî we just love gambling (because we‚Äôre degenerates).

                <p>
                  The extra $15 will go toward a bigger pot and/or side bets. We‚Äôll finalize that before the 2026 season starts.

                  <li><strong>Benchwarmers Week:</strong> At the nine week mark, we will use a randomizer to select a random week out of the first eight weeks, and whichever team had the benched player with the most points in that week gets a the $25 side bet</li>

                  <li><strong>Survivor:</strong> Each week, lowest scorer is dropped until one remains ‚Äî winner gets $25</li>
